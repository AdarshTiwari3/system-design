"""The Proxy implementation of an API Gateway acts as an intermediary between the client and the actual service classes. When a client makes a request, the proxy receives it, performs any required pre-processing (like authentication, logging, or rate limiting), and then delegates the request to the appropriate real service class. It may also handle post-processing before sending the response back to the client"""
