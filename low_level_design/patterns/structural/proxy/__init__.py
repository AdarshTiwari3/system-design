"""
Proxy Design Pattern:
 It is used to add additional behavior (e.g., logging, access control, lazy loading) without modifying the actual object.
 A proxy sits between the client and the real object, intercepting calls and optionally altering the behavior.

When it is used- 
1. When some preprocessing or postprocessing is required
2. When some access restriction is applicable
