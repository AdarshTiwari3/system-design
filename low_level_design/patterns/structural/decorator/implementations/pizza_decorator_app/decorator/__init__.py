"""In this implementation, we define a decorator as an abstract base class (or interface), along with its concrete subclasses.
The decorator follows both an is-a and has-a relationship: it is-a component (through inheritance) and has-a component (via composition), enabling it to wrap and extend the behavior of other components dynamically
