"""
The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that lets you add new operations to existing object structures without modifying their classes.

It achieves this by allowing you to separate the algorithm from the objects it operates on.

Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.

It’s particularly useful in situations where:

You have a complex object structure (like ASTs(tree-like data structure), documents, or UI elements) that you want to perform multiple unrelated operations on.
You want to add new behaviors to classes without changing their source code.
You need to perform different actions depending on an object’s concrete type, without resorting to a long chain of if-else or instanceof checks.

Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
