"""
The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers, allowing each handler to decide whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

It’s particularly useful in situations where:

• A request must be handled by one of many possible handlers, and you don’t want the sender to be tightly coupled to any specific one.
• You want to decouple request logic from the code that processes it.
• You want to flexibly add, remove, or reorder handlers without changing the client code.
