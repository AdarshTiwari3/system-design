"""Memento is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

- The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you save and restore an object’s state without exposing its internal details.

- Use the Memento pattern when you want to produce snapshots of the object’s state to be able to restore a previous state of the object.

- Use the pattern when direct access to the object’s fields/getters/setters violates its encapsulation.

-  The Memento makes the object itself responsible for creating a snapshot of its state. No other object can read the snapshot, making the original object’s state data safe and secure.
