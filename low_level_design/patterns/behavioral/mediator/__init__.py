"""
The Mediator Design Pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines an object (the Mediator) to encapsulate how a set of objects interact.

It promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other directly, and lets you vary their interactions independently.

Itâ€™s particularly useful in situations where:

You have a group of tightly coupled classes or UI components that need to communicate.
Changes in one component require updates in multiple others.
You want to centralize communication logic to simplify maintenance and testing.

The Mediator Pattern promotes loose coupling by centralizing communication between objects. Instead of having components refer to and interact with each other directly, they communicate through a mediator.
