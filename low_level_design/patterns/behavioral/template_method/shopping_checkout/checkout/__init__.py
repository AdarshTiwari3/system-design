"""Checkout Implementation(Template Design Pattern)

Template Method Pattern:
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class while allowing subclasses 
to override specific steps without altering the overall flow.  
Key terms: Template Method (algorithm structure), Abstract Methods (custom steps), 
Concrete Methods (shared logic), and Hooks (optional overrides).  
Promotes code reuse, consistency, and flexibility across varying implementations.
