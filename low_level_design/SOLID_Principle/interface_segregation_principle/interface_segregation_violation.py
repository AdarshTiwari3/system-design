# lets see the example where isp rule is violated


'''
ISP- A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use

An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods a class must implement â€” without providing any implementation itself
like abstract class

In other words:
-Break big, general-purpose interfaces into smaller, role-specific ones.
-Let classes implement only what they actually need.


 ISP helps enforce SRP(single responsibilty) by splitting large interfaces into smaller ones, each with a single responsibility.
