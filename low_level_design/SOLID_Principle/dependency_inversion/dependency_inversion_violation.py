DIP Violation
DBService (the high-level class) directly depends on PostgreSQLDataBase (a low-level class).

If you later want to:

Switch to MySQLDatabase

Add logging

Test with a mock database
â†’ you'd need to modify DBService, which breaks modularity and violates OCP (Open/Closed Principle) as well
