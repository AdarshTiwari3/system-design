# System Design Repository

Welcome to the **System Design** repository â€” a comprehensive resource dedicated to mastering software design principles, patterns, and best practices. This repository is structured to provide both theoretical and practical knowledge on **Low-Level Design (LLD)** and **High-Level Design (HLD)** concepts.

---

## Repository Overview

This repository aims to serve as a solid foundation for developers through clear explanations, hands-on code examples, and some unit testing.

### High-Level Design (HLD)

- Covers architectural patterns and system components design.
- Focuses on designing scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems.

### Low-Level Design (LLD)

- Detailed exploration of essential **design patterns** commonly used in software development.
- Practice questions to reinforce understanding of design concepts.
- Emphasis on **SOLID principles** with clear, annotated code implementations.
- Unit testing of SOLID principles code using **pytest**, ensuring code correctness and reliability.

---

## Key Features

- **SOLID Principles**  
  Clear, well-documented implementations of each SOLID principle, illustrating their importance and practical usage in software design.

- **Design Patterns**  
  Covers widely used design patterns with example implementations and explanations to demonstrate best practices.

- **Practice Problems**  
  Thoughtfully crafted exercises to apply learned design concepts and patterns in real-world scenarios.

- **Unit Testing**  
  Comprehensive test suites using `pytest` that validate the correctness and robustness of design principle implementations(only with SOLID principles explanation).
